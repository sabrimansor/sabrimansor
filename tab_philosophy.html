                             Admit it when you make a mistake. Give clothes not worn to charity. Do something nice and
                             try not to get caught. Listen more; talk less. Everyday take a 30-minute walk. Strive for excellence, not perfection.
                             Be on time. Don't make excuses. Don't argue. Get organized. Be kind to people. Be kind to unkind people.
                             Let someone cut ahead of you in line. Take time to be alone. Cultivate good manners. Be humble. Realize and
                             accept that life isn't fair. Know when to keep your mouth shut. Go an entire day without criticizing anyone.
                             Learn from the past. Plan for the future. Live in the present. Don't sweat the small stuff. It's all small stuff."</i></td></tr>
